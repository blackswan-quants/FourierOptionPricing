# FourierOptionPricing
Project to develop a Python pricing engine for European options using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The goal is to value options using the characteristic function, overcoming model limitations (e.g., Black-Scholes) and extending analysis to more realistic models like Heston or Merton.
